# NetQuoteCross

<p>This project demonstrates how to use platform-specific code in Kotlin (for Android) and Swift (for iOS) to fetch daily internet usage data and how to call these methods from a Flutter app. Additionally, the app fetches a random quote from an API and displays it on the main screen.</p>
<p>Flutter provides a powerful way to execute platform-specific code written in Kotlin (for Android) and Swift (for iOS) from your Dart code. This is achieved through platform channels, which enable communication between the Flutter framework and the native code.</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>
In a Flutter app, you can use platform channels to:

* Execute Kotlin code on Android devices.
* Execute Swift code on iOS devices.

This approach allows you to leverage platform-specific APIs and functionalities that are not directly available in Flutter.

<h4>How Platform Channels Work</h4>
Platform channels use a binary messaging system to communicate between Dart and platform-specific code. The communication flow is as follows:

1. Flutter sends a message from Dart to the platform-specific code.
2. The platform-specific code (Kotlin/Swift) handles the message and performs the necessary operations.
3. The platform-specific code sends a response back to Flutter.

<h3>Features:</h3>

- Fetch daily internet usage data using platform-specific code:
    - **Android:** Implemented in Kotlin
    - **iOS:** Implemented in Swift
- Fetch a random quote from an API and display it in the app.
- Flip animation for displaying quotes.
- Platform checks to handle platform-specific logic.
